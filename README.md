Roman Numerals Convertor

This is a simple convertor to convert from standard numbers to roman numerals

see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Reading_Roman_numerals)

This is a coding sample I had to implement for a job application. The requirements are to:

**"Build a program that can convert standard numbers (between 1 and 3000) into Roman Numerals (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Reading_Roman_numerals).
 - for bonus points, convert from Roman Numerals back into standard numbers."**


See this project's commit history for more insight on how it was developed using TDD (and also look at ConvertorTest to more explanation of the approach I took to implement it).
